# Toxxy's Hell - Plast Pack

### A customized version of the Plast Pack resource pack!  
The Purpose of this texture pack is to fit my *own* style, and is fairly similar to my BetterDiscord theme [SimplyDark - Fuchsia Darkness](https://github.com/ToxxyTheTrash/SimplyDarkFuchsiaDarkness)

The texture pack supports and is **intended** to be used with Optifine.  
The texture pack works with some pre-combat updates (1.7.x-1.8.x) and all post-combat update Minecraft versions (v1.9.x-1.17.x).

### Support for Mods!  
That's right! I've modified some textures in Tinkers Construct, Iron Chests and JEI and added them in to keep consistency with my texture pack and its UI. The custom textures are now built in directly into the texture pack. **Some unfinished changes in 1.1.9.5 for now**.

### Addon - Vanilla Tweaks  
I've made my own little pack for Vanilla Tweaks collection, which should spice up the texture pack a bit more. Limited on what I was able to add since adding more (ie. Bushy leaves, Groovy levers, just to name a couple) would require editing/fixing of the VT texture pack, which I do not want to. Anyways, here's the collection link: https://vanillatweaks.net/share#LsH4zj
